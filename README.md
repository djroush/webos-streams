# Webos Streams
This is a personal project for me to learn React and Typescript.  This is a single page application which integrates to the Twitch Helix API using OAuth.  The long term goal is to make this into a SmartTV app for WebOS TVs (i.e: LG)

### Running 
To run the project locally (on port 80) run the following command:
`yarn start`

### Testing
Test have not yet been implemented and they will not work.  If they were implemented, the command to run them would be:
`yarn test`
